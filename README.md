My task was to develop an online message management system, consisting of three layers (web portal, middle layer and database).  The middle layer needs is implemented conforming to Java Servlet standard. Using my solution, users are able to register in the system, create user’s session to use the system, Add/Remove/Update/Search messages, mark messages as ‘public’, so everyone could see its content, or mark messages as ‘private’, so only message’s author can see the content.
